ndiswrapper
###########

`ndiswrapper <http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net>`_ is an implementation
of Network Driver Interface (NDIS) for Linux kernel. With this,
NDIS drivers can be used in Linux kernel to support chipsets
that have no native implementation or not well supported in Linux.

Current implementation supports many chipsets / drivers that use
NDIS 5. Windows XP drivers are implemented with NDIS 5.

There is an (incomplete) implementation of
`NDIS 6 <https://github.com/pgiri/ndiswrapper/tree/ndisv6>`_, but it is
not useful to users as of now.
